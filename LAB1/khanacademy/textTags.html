        <strong>Nobody's born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can't talk, can't walk, certainly can't do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody's good at anything at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn't count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, you <em>walk.</em><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It's not that you don't get it. <br>
        You just don't get it, yet.
        Because the most <em>beautiful, complex</em> concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn <em>anything.</em></strong>
